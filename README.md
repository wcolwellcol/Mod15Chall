# Mod15Chall

This is a chatbot that I built utilizing Amazon Lex and Amazon Lambda. The chatbot has only one intent which is to recommend a portfolio for someone seeking to invest for retirement.

## Technologies
In order to replicate this project, one would have to set up various services through AWS. This includes the use of Amazon Lex and Amazon Lambda specifically.

## Usage

The video of my chatbot without the lambda function is stored here [Screen Recording](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod15Chall/blob/main/Screen_record_trimmed.mov)

The video of my chatbot with the lambda function is stored here [Screen Recording](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod15Chall/blob/main/Screen%20Recording%202023-07-05%20at%2010.30.48%20AM.mov)

The actual code for my lambda function is stored in the lambda folder [here](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod15Chall/tree/main/Lambda)

The [Test_Events](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod15Chall/tree/main/Test_Events) folder contains various json files which I utilized to test whether my chatbot was working as intended.
